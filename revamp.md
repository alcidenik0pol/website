This website needs to be completely revamped, from design, to structure, to content.

# Current Issues


Issues:
- It makes me look incredibly junior
- It has no clear audience
- It doesn't really serve a purpose.


# New Philosophy:

Tier 1: Professional Identity (Real Name)
Purpose: Signal seniority, reduce perceived risk for employers
Content: Finished work only. No process, no "learning journey"
Channels:
- LinkedIn (founder/technical framing)
- Personal website (researcher-style portfolio) -> this website
- GitHub (curated, finished projects only)

Rule: Nothing here explains how you did it. Just that you did it and the results.

## Implementation

Analogy: researcher 


### Method
Keep existing content, keep copy of old pages but in different addresses -> create new pages and content IN ADDITION

Design: Start from scratch and use shadcn skill
